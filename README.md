##What?
Primairly for Mac OSX, when this application is complete it will automatically upload screen caps to imgur, and provide a link to the image.

##Why?!
During my college years I found it tedious to share photos of math/physics/chemistry problems with friends. This will expedite the process. There are (probably) apps that already do this but...I'm also completing this for my own edification! 

##Progess so far.
The program is functional in that it provides the user with a link of the screencap following the file creation but, the execution of this process still needs work! The link is currently provided in the terminal, and the user does not have many options (which album to upload to etc.)

###Logging in
The imgur API requires the user to retrieve a PIN that is specifically made for the user and the registered application.

###Let it sit in the tray
The program then sits in the tray and scans the desktop directory.

###Link provided
This will eventually be provided in baloon format. (Rather than the terminal).
